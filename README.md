  <summary>About the people to made the hacks!</summary>
 <hr />
 Currently, manually hacking Prodigy Math Game on mobile devices is not possible to do manually, which is why I have created this station. All hacked accounts are made using hacks created by
            <a href="http://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/">ProdigyMathGameHacking</a>. <b>An order of any amount of accounts are free</b>
          .  The ProdigyMathGameHacking Code of Conduct does apply. My motiviation is the same as ProdigyMathGameHacking:
            <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #ddd; padding-left: 10px;">
                We're not trying to break the game because we're evil. We just wanted to help Prodigy become more secure, but they've ignored our emails and our requests to talk.
                <br/>
                Because of that we're just publicly showing hacks! That, and it's also just fun ;)
                <br/>
                All of our hacks are open source, and free. No paywalls, no ads, and no Patreon.
